 This is a personality test application which I coded using python. This interactive application tasks the users with a series of 10 questions and then corroborates the results from the responses to give users a fun personality type.

 **Initial project Idea:**
I was tasked with the objective to develop an interactive program that composed of a series of questions that prompt a response of the user.I was to program the application to recognize and store the input from the user to categorize the selections of the user into a category that yields that personality type.

**Challenges I faced:**
I found this challenging as I had to develop a code for undesired capitalization or numbers.

**Tools I used:**
 I utilized python as the programming language. To allow the program to run smoothly, I had to insert a code for error checking for each question type. 

 **Result:**
 I accomplished the challenge or error checking by reprompting the user to select only the options provided in the program.
